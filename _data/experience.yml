    As a part of SSAD (Structured System Analysis and Design) course,
    I worked as an Intern at Nebulaesoft. As a part of the internship,
    I worked on building Dashboard API's for the app, Boostr

    We built MongoDb based models for storing relevant data such as Sales Summary
    Stats, Overall Company level stats etc. Then we built API calls for calculating
    these stats on a daily, weekly, monthly basis, and periodic updation of these
    MongoDb components

    This was my first software internship and it gave me a feel of working in a
    realtime, software development environment, and understanding how software
    technologies, testing tools and version control are used in the workplace
