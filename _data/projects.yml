         Built a Bash-like shell using C and POSIX Syscalls.
         - Implemented certain built-in commands from scratch (cd, ls, pwd, echo).
         - Implemented background and foreground processes, piping and redirection.

        Using basic concepts such as PCA and basic Python libraries such as
        **Numpy**, **PIL**, I built a face recognition classifier

        Using PCA each image has been converted into a lower dimensional representation
        using Eigen faces, for storage, and ease of operating upon

        Mini Projects done as a part of Graphics
  description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
        Part of Graphics Course using OpenGL and WebGL, I designed a few games.
        - A 2D Mario type game, where the player controls a ball, in a terrain collecting coins and killing enemy spikes.
        - A 3D version of Legend of Zelda, where the character moves in a boat, killing monsters of various difficulties, and various views.
        - Used WebGl to create a tunnel rush game.
        - In all these projects, I extensively used, the concepts of camera movement, rotation, changing perspective.
