    I love learning new things, and **books** are my way of doing so. I am an avid
    reader. I also have been learning **the guitar** for a while. I love watching
    **cartoons**, especially the ones that have been around since childhood.
    *Pokemon*, *ATLA* anyone ?

    I am a **Toastmaster**, at IIIT-H Toastmasters club, where I have been improving my
    public speaking skills and ofcourse, having a lot of fun.
